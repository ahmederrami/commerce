Hi there,
My name is Ahmed. I'm from Morocco.
The objective of this video is to give you a demonstration of a website that I have developed as a project concerning the online training "web programming with
Python and Javascript".
The website is for an online auction market where seller wish to sell an item (it may be a car, a computer or what ever) and buyers can make their offers on
that item. After an agreed time, the winner will be the buyer who offer the highest price.
1- So anyone can go to the website and view the items for sell. If he is interested, he can create his profile. He needs to provide his login, his mail adress and
his password.
2- Once a user is logged in, he can add a listing by specifying a title, a description, a starting price, a category and also an image for the item.
3- Then the registred item appears directly on the auction list and other users can consult it.
4- So if I log out and log in as another user, I can go to the item detail and do several actions. I can add it to my watchlist. If the item is already on the
watchlist I can remove it. I can also bid on it but my offer must be greater than the maximum bid. Otherwise I get an error message.
What's more, I can add a comment and the system informs me that my comment was added. As you can see, the listing page displays all comments that have been made
on the listing.
If the current user is the one who created the listing, he has the ability to close it. This makes the highest bidder the winner of the auction and makes the
listing no longer active. So the closed listing doesn't appear on the active listing page and the winner is informed that he won the auction.
5- If the current user has registered some listings on his watchlist, he can view them. Clicking on any of those listings takes the user to that listingâ€™s page.
6- Users is able to visit a page that displays a list of all listing categories. Clicking on the name of any category should take the user to a page that displays all of the active listings in that category.
7- Via the Django admin interface, a site administrator is able to view, add, edit, and delete any
listings, comments, and bids made on the site.
